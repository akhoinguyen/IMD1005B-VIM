            <h2>MEXICO LINDO</h2>
            <p>Mexican cuisine is a rich and diverse culinary tradition that reflects the country's deep history, blending indigenous Mesoamerican ingredients with Spanish, African, and even Asian influences. Rooted in staples like corn, beans, chili peppers, and squash, it has evolved through centuries of cultural exchange to create bold, flavorful dishes that vary by region.</p>
            <p>From the smoky complexity of Oaxacan mole to the fresh seafood of the coastal regions and the hearty, meat-based dishes of the north, Mexican food is as diverse as its landscapes. Traditional techniques like nixtamalization and the use of stone-ground corn for tortillas remain central, while dishes such as tacos, tamales, and birria continue to define its global appeal.</p>
